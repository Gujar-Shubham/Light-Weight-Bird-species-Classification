# Light-Weight-Bird-species-Classification
Bird Species Classification project was assigned to me under the Summer research Internship for leadingindia.ai at Bennett University. A team was formed and we collectively contributed to this project. We work on this project for 6 weeks. . A lightweight Bird species classifier using Deep Learning as a topic was introduced to us by our mentor Tejalal Choudhary. We studied this idea over the Deep learning models and shall provide a rational and impactful review of them in this blog.This dataset is available at Kaggle on the following link https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/100-bird-species

Deployed the trained model using Android studio and  Flutter into a Android App AIbird.
